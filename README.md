# base-lib
**base-lib** is a base library for a number of libraries and applications under the uk.co.lukestevens group. It contains interfaces, annotations, and utilities for use by other
libraries.

## Installation

Install the latest version of base-lib using Maven:

```	
<dependency>
	<groupId>uk.co.lukestevens</groupId>
	<artifactId>base-lib</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Github Packages Authentication
Currently public packages on Github require authentication to be installed by Maven. Add the following repository to your project's `.m2/settings.xml`

```
<repository>
	<id>github-lukecmstevens</id>
	<name>GitHub lukecmstevens Apache Maven Packages</name>
	<url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/lukecmstevens/packages</url>
	<snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
</repository>
```

For more information see here: [Authenticating with Github packages][gh-package-auth]

## Usage
base-lib provides a range of utility classes, including those for mocking dates and environment variables.

### Dates
The `Dates` class provides wrapped methods to allow timestamp based instantiation to be mocked.

```
new Date(); // instead of this
Dates.now(); // use this

Calendar.getInstance(); // instead of this
Dates.getCalendar(); // use this

System.currentTimeMillis(); // instead of this
Dates.millis(); // use this
```

This will enable you to easy mock the timestamp of created dates in tests with

```
DateMocker.setCurrentDate(date);
DateMocker.removeMockedDate();
```

### Environment Variables
The `EnvironmentVariables` class provides wrapped methods to allow environment variables to be mocked

```
System.getenv(); // instead of this
EnvironmentVariables.get(); // use this

System.getenv(string); // instead of this
EnvironmentVariables.get(string); // use this
```

This will enable you to easily build a set of mocked environment variables to test applications
dependent on them. For example:

```
EnvironmentVariableMocker.build()
		.with(properties)
		.with(key, value)
		.mock();
EnvironmentVariableMocker.clear();
```
